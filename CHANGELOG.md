# Changelog

All notable changes to Vitals will be documented in this file.

## [2.5.8] - 2026-10-05 (malusama fork)

### Changed
- Open every card with its complete readings and graphs visible; remove the disclosure buttons and collapsed summaries.
- Keep the narrow layout and text-size-aware spacing from 2.5.7.
- Replace all three README screenshots with the fully expanded light, dark, and 130% text layouts.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-10-05 (malusama fork)

### Changed
- Tighter card and toolbar padding, with detail spacing that compensates for larger text, let all six core cards fit fully expanded on the tested display.
- Preserve the 280-point single column, all detailed readings, text sizes, and graph heights.
- Refresh README screenshots, including the fully expanded six-card layout.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-10-05 (malusama fork)

### Added
- A 280-point single-column overview with expandable cards. Adapter input and battery charging/output power stay visible when the battery card is collapsed.
- Native screenshots of the compact light/dark layout and expanded details in the README.

### Changed
- Clearer metric hierarchy and light/dark contrast across the popover cards.
- Separate disk read/write readings and dynamically scaled network graphs.
- Popover sizing follows its content and the screen containing the menu bar item.

### Fixed
- Battery charging status follows the measured signed battery power, including discharge while connected to AC.
- Adapter input is distinguished from the negotiated adapter limit; missing power readings display a dash.
- Battery data refreshes on macOS power notifications and before opening the popover.

## [2.5] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- **Widgets that work for everyone** — the Storage, Battery, and System Info widgets now compute their data themselves inside the widget process (disk capacity via volume resource values, battery via `IOPowerSources`/IORegistry, uptime and system info via `sysctl`), so they show real data even on the pre-built (unsigned) DMG build that has no valid App Group entitlement. Widgets no longer depend on the running app to populate a shared file
- **Battery health in the Battery widget** — the widget now surfaces battery health % and cycle count, a figure macOS doesn't expose anywhere obvious, right on your desktop
- **System Info widget** — a new widget showing a live, ticking uptime (rendered client-side via `Text(_:style:)`, so it stays current without spending timeline refreshes), plus macOS version, Mac model, and boot time
- **Top Processes** — a new card in the popover listing the top 5 processes by **CPU** or **Memory** (segmented switch). CPU % matches Activity Monitor, and the scan only runs while the popover is open and the section is visible, so it stays battery-friendly
- **Czech localization** — the entire app and its widgets are now localized; the language follows your system by default, with a System / English / Čeština switch (and a Relaunch button) in General settings
- **Check for Updates** — a button in Settings > General > About that queries the GitHub Releases API on demand and links you to a newer release when one exists. Privacy-first: it only runs when you click it, no accounts, no automatic requests

### Changed
- **Real-time widgets removed** — the System Overview, System Health, and Network Info widgets have been retired. They rendered instantaneous values (CPU/RAM gauges, Wi-Fi signal, network speeds), but WidgetKit only grants an extension a limited refresh budget (~15 minutes between reloads when the app isn't driving them), so those numbers were routinely 15 minutes stale and effectively lying. They also relied on the shared App Group file, which is empty on unsigned builds. Real-time monitoring stays where it works well: the menu bar and the popover. The remaining widgets show either semi-static data or values that are cheap to read fresh on every refresh
- **Widget redesign** — every widget now shares a unified header, a full-width two-column layout that reads like a neat table (and never breaks long Czech labels mid-word), SF Pro Rounded typography, and monospaced digits so values don't jitter

### Fixed
- **Battery health on Apple Silicon** — capacity values are now also read from the nested `BatteryData` dictionary in the `AppleSmartBattery` service, not just the top-level keys (where `MaxCapacity` is only a percentage on Apple Silicon). Battery health % had been missing from the popover since v2.3 on these Macs

## [2.4] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Public IP privacy toggle** — new "Show public IP" switch in General settings; the app queries `api.ipify.org` only when you turn it on
- **Unified logging** — every part of the app and the widget extension now logs to the macOS unified logging system under the subsystem `com.filiphajduch.vitals`, with per-area categories (`app`, `power`, `sharing`, `widgets`, and one per monitor), so failures (IOKit/SMC reads, `sysctl`, `metrics.json` writes, missing App Group container, network errors, JSON decode) explain themselves
- **Copy log command** — button in Settings > General > About that copies a ready-to-run `log show` command to your clipboard for troubleshooting
- **Troubleshooting / Logs** section in the README with `log show`/`log stream` examples and category filtering

### Changed
- **Local IP without forking a process** — Wi-Fi local IP is now read directly via `getifaddrs()` instead of spawning `ipconfig` every 2 seconds, cutting constant fork/exec overhead and battery drain
- **Monitoring pauses on sleep** — polling stops when the display or system sleeps and resumes on wake, so Vitals no longer reads sensors, spawns processes, or writes to disk with the screen off
- **Off-main-thread widget writes** — `metrics.json` is now encoded and written off the main thread on a serialized writer and throttled to roughly once every 15 seconds instead of every 2 seconds, keeping the UI smooth and letting the SSD idle
- **Single timer** — the separate menu bar label timer was removed; the label now redraws the moment new metrics arrive, halving timer wake-ups and keeping the label in sync with the data
- **Cached slow-changing values** — battery cycle count, capacity, and temperature (values that barely change) are cached with a short TTL instead of being read from IOKit on every tick; design capacity is read once
- **Widget refresh budget** — the widget timeline reload policy changed from `.atEnd` to `.after(15 min)` so widgets stop burning through WidgetKit's refresh budget; the running app still drives live updates
- **Distribution build** — `create-dmg.sh` now ad-hoc signs the app and widget with a hardened runtime, stages into private per-run temp directories, and publishes a SHA-256 checksum alongside the DMG
- **Install instructions** — README and website now document the "Open Anyway" flow (right-click → Open no longer works on macOS 15+), the `xattr` alternative, checksum verification, and why the pre-built widgets may not show data
- **Setup guidance** — `setup.sh` no longer references a stale App Group ID; it explains that the ID is derived automatically from your signing team

### Fixed
- **False memory alarms gone** — memory pressure now comes from the real kernel signal (`kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`) instead of a RAM-usage ratio, so a healthy Mac no longer shows bogus "warning"/"critical" states in the app or the System Health widget
- **Wi-Fi data race** — `WiFiMonitor` is now an `actor`, eliminating a real data race on its cached SSID/public-IP state when polling restarts (interval change or AC↔battery switch)
- **Dead code removed** — unused `MenuBarLabel` and `CompactMetricView` (one of which spuriously started a second monitoring loop) were deleted; the byte formatter is now a cached instance; and the menu bar "Reset to Default" now matches a fresh install

### Security
- **Public IP lookup is opt-in and off by default** — no automatic third-party requests to `api.ipify.org`; nothing is sent unless you explicitly enable "Show public IP"
- **`metrics.json` created private from the start** — the shared metrics file is created with `0600` permissions up front, closing the brief window where it could have been world-readable
- **Signed, verifiable downloads** — DMG builds are ad-hoc signed with a hardened runtime and ship with a SHA-256 checksum you can verify
- **No predictable staging paths** — the DMG build stages into private `mktemp -d` directories (0700) instead of shared `/tmp` paths, removing a local TOCTOU risk
- **`PowerStateMonitor` retain/release fixed** — the IOKit callback context is now balanced with a paired release, correcting a leak-and-potential-use-after-free pattern

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **SMC read regression** — `output2` vs `output` typo in `ThermalMonitor.smcRead` caused all SMC sensor reads to return nil, hiding CPU temperature, fan RPM, GPU temperature, and system power in the popover

## [2.3] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **System Overview widget** — new medium + large widget showing Battery and Storage as side-by-side donut rings with network info below (SSID, signal bars, IPs on large)
- **Widget tinted mode** — `widgetAccentable` support for macOS Tahoe tinted rendering
- **Shared widget components** — `DonutRing`, `WidgetGradientBackground`, `WidgetHeader`, `WidgetStatRow`, `BigPercent` extracted into `VitalsWidgets/Components/WidgetComponents.swift` for reuse

### Changed
- **Complete widget redesign** — all widgets now use donut rings with angular gradients, dark gradient backgrounds with status-color glow, and SF Pro Rounded typography
- **Storage widget** — large donut ring showing used %, free space below
- **Battery widget** — donut ring with lightning bolt overlay when charging; Status/Health/Cycles/Time rows on medium
- **Network Info widget** — donut ring showing signal quality % mapped from RSSI, IP and signal details below

### Fixed
- **Widget data sharing** — restored App Group container (regression from v2.2 refactor had broken widget data reads)
- **WiFi empty SSID** — handle empty string (not just nil); shows "Wi-Fi" label when macOS hides the network name

### Security
- **Memory leaks** — `IOObjectRelease` via `defer` in DiskMonitor and GPUMonitor prevents leaked IOKit handles on error paths
- **PowerStateMonitor** — retain/release fix on context pointer eliminates use-after-free risk
- **ThermalMonitor** — SMC bounds check prevents buffer overread when reading thermal sensor data
- **Public IP lookup** — HTTP status check and IPv4/IPv6 format validation before trusting response
- **WiFi SSID lookup** — `autoreleasepool` wrap around `SCDynamicStore` calls to prevent long-lived CF leaks
- **File permissions** — `metrics.json` written with `0o600` (owner-only read/write)
- **App Transport Security** — `NSAppTransportSecurity` disallows arbitrary loads (HTTPS only)
- **Safe URL unwrap** — `GeneralSettingsView` GitHub link guarded against invalid URL
- **Binary size** — release-config symbol stripping reduces attack surface
